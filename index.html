  <h2 id="what-is-version-control">What is Version Control?</h2>

  <p>Imagine you’re working on a paper CancerEvolution.docx and
  you re-write a section but you’re not sure if you want to keep
  it. Therefore, you “Save As” under
  “CancerEvolutionRewrite.docx”. As you’re working on this
  you end up re-writing another section and “Save As” to create
  a slightly different copy. Or maybe you just create draft after
  draft and want to have different versions for later. You’re
  essentially creating different version of the same document and
  manually organizing them on your desktop! Not very effective
  though.</p>

  <h2 id="what-is-git">What is Git?</h2>

  <p>A version control system for code! Gone are the days of
  “FinalPaperDraft.docx”, “FinalPaperDraftFinal.docx”,
  “FinalPaperDraftFinalFinal.docx”.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“By far, the most widely used modern version control
    system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature, actively
    maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by
    Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating
    system kernel. A staggering number of software projects rely on
    Git for version control, including commercial projects as well
    as open source.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It’s extremely useful for tracking and undoing changes to
  your code over time, as well as sharing your code with
  others.</p>

  <h2 id="what-is-github">What is GitHub?</h2>

  <p>It’s a online platform that lets you store and version
  control your code. It’s built around Git. There are others like
  it, such as GitLab and BitBucket.</p>

  <h2 id="so-whats-the-meaningful-difference-between-them">So
  what’s the meaningful difference between them?</h2>

  <p>Good question. Git exists purely on the command line, and is
  maintained independently from these platforms. You don’t need
  to know the command line to use GitHub or GitLab, you just need
  to understand what version control is (and how to
  copy-paste)!</p>

  <h2 id="how-to-use-github">How to use GitHub?</h2>

  <p>There are a few different ways!</p>

  <ol type="1">
    <li>Their Website – <a href=
    "http:/github.com">Github.com</a><br>
    <img src="./images/create_github_repo.png" alt=

    <li>The desktop app – <a href=

    <img src="./images/github_desktop.png" alt=
    "Creating a GitHub repo from GitHub Desktop" width="400"></li>

    <li>The command line – <code>hub</code> – <code>brew
    install hub</code><br>
      <img src="./images/github_cli.png" alt=
      "Creating a GitHub repo from CLI" width="400">

      <ul>
        <li>the only* thing you can’t do with standalone
        <code>git</code> is create repositories</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>An IDE like Atom! (GitHub integration)<br>
    <img src="./images/atom_github_support.png" alt=

  </ol>

  <p>As a note, being a student gets you a <a href=
  "https://education.github.com/pack">premium version (Github
  Student Dev pack)</a> of Github for free</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>It includes everything in GitHub Free, unlimited
    collaborators for private repositories, and advanced code
    review tools for private and public repositories.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h1 id="git-concepts">Git Concepts</h1>

  <h2 id="the-repository">The Repository</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>When you are working on a project and want to use version
    control, you need to first create a repository (“repo”) for
    it</li>

    <li>You need to interface with Github for this (or install the
    <code>hub</code> command)</li>

    <li>It can be public or private</li>

    <li>The repository is where you’ll send your updates</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="commits">Commits</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>When you make changes, you need to submit them to be
    saved</li>

    <li>You need to specify which changes you want to save!

      <ul>
        <li>You might have various things that you’re working on,
        and only finished one of them that you want to commit</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>You must “git add” the files that you want to
    “save”</li>

    <li>A commit is like a “soft-save” because it’s only
    local

      <ul>
        <li>this can be nice—you don’t always have an internet
        connection</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>You need to publish your commits to make them global and
    visible to others!</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="pushing-pulling">Pushing, Pulling</h2>

  <p>This is how we publish and retrieve changes!</p>

  <p>You push your local changes out to the repo, and then others
  can pull them in. Sometimes you’ve edited the same thing as
  someone else, and Git can’t figure out how to automatically
  combine them—this is when you’ll need to decide what to keep
  and what to toss. Situations like this can be frustrating when
  you’re working with other people, so sometimes it’s nice to
  have your own git workspace.</p>

  <h2 id="branching-and-merging">Branching and Merging</h2>

  <p>Want to start adding something new but don’t want to
  interfere with the stable code? Time to start a new branch! By
  default, you’re on the “master” branch.</p>

  <div class="sourceCode" id="cb1">
    <pre class="sourceCode bash">
<code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1"
title="1" name="cb1-1"><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class=
"fu">git</span> checkout -b dev_branch</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" title="2" name=
"cb1-2"><span class="ex">Switched</span> to a new branch <span class="st">&#39;dev_branch&#39;</span></a></code>
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Branches are useful for developing new features in isolation.
  Creating a new branch creates a copy of the old branch, but now
  you can grow it separately. When you’re done, you can splice
  that branch back into the main tree!</p>

  <p>What is this splicing exactly? It’s the “merge”
  operation. Merging is best done when there aren’t conflicts
  between the new cold and the old code, but Git helps you handle
  conflicts when they arise.</p>

  <h2 id="whats-all-this-about-origin-and-master">What’s all this
  about Origin and Master?</h2>

  <p>The “origin” is the remote location that is housing the
  code. By default, it is named “origin”, which is just a
  convention that arose.</p>

  <p>You can set up different remote locations if you like—I have
  set up both GitHub and GitLab on the same repository, I just
  needed to push my changes to each remote location.</p>

  <p>The “master” is the default branch that is created when
  you’re working on a project. It, too, is a common convention.
  Amazon uses “mainline’ as their default name, and other
  companies are switching away from the”master" terminology.
  Branching is a useful feature for developing new or experimental
  changes in isolation without impacting the existing code.</p>

  <h2 id="so-these-are-all-words-but-can-you-give-an-analogy">So
  these are all words, but can you give an analogy?</h2>

  <p>I think it all comes together like growing a <strong>bonsai
  tree</strong> in your house. All together, it’s a gradual
  process where you can curate designs and shapes with the wood.
  You can keep the blinds closed or let specific people into your
  house!</p>

  <p><strong>A Pot with Soil</strong>: Having a GitHub or GitLab
  account is having a place to grow your plant. It’s your pot
  with soil.</p>

  <p><strong>A Seed</strong>: Creating the repo is like planting a
  seed—now you can watch it grow.</p>

  <p><strong>Taking up Nutrients…</strong>: Adding changes to
  your files! These are what you need to grow the project.</p>

  <p><strong>Growing Taller</strong>: Committing those changes to
  your project grows it. Commit after commit, the project grows
  bigger.</p>

  <p><strong>Opening the Blinds</strong>: Push! People need to see
  your project! If you don’t push your local changes to the repo,
  they might as well not exist! That said, you can push to a
  <em>private</em> repo, so that only people you let inside your
  house can see the bonsai tree.</p>

  <p><strong>Branching</strong>: Very literal here. You’re
  growing out a new branch from the trunk. The trunk will continue
  to be the main part of the tree, but the branch can grow
  separately.</p>

  <p><strong>Splicing A Branch Back In</strong>: Merging! You’re
  reintroducing a branch that previously diverged. Now it’s part
  of the main tree again and brought back some changes with it.</p>

  <p>This metaphor falls apart a bit once you start factoring in
  other people. For example, what exactly is a merge conflict on a
  bonsai tree? What is rebasing? There’s probably a joke about
  <code>cherry-pick</code>ing here (a surprisingly useful git
  command). But it’s still a useful starting analogy.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 id="what-is-it-under-the-hood">What Is It Under The
  Hood?</h2>

  <p>Complex and abstract. It’s essentially a giant python
  dictionary with a few different types of objects in it (tree
  objects, commit objects, and blobs). At the same time, it holds
  within it a graph structure. Most people use it for years and
  years without ever bothering with what’s going on underneath
  and, frankly, I think it’s not worth understanding.</p>
  <hr>

  <h1 id="example">Example</h1>

  <p>Let’s create a repository!</p>

  <ol type="1">
    <li>You need to have a GitHub account</li>

    <li>You need to have GitHub Desktop installed</li>
  </ol>

  <p>So let’s get started! GitHub has a few cute features with
  repos. Whenever you’re looking at a repo, if there’s a
  document named “README.*”, it will be displayed! The most
  common format is <a href=
  "https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">Markdown</a>, which
  uses the extension “*.md”. It’s considered good practice to
  always include a README in the root of your repo with information
  about it, such as instructions on using it.</p>

  <p>GitHub also has a few repository names that it can treat
  differently. For example, if you name a repo
  “[username].github.io”, GitHub will actually create a new
  address for you there, and you can create your own small, static
  website! Try visiting <a href=
  "https://matthewwolff.github.io">matthewwolff.github.io</a>!
  Today, however, we’re going to create a different kind of
  specially named repo.</p>

  <ol type="1">
    <li>Open GitHub desktop</li>

    <li>Create a new (local) repository<br>
      <img src="./images/create_new_repo.png" width="400">

      <ul>
        <li>ctrl-N or CMD-N</li>

        <li>The name will be your github username</li>

        <li>Initialize it with a README

          <ul>
            <li>what is a readme?</li>

            <li>what is markdown?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Publish your repository

      <ul>
        <li>Make sure it’s public!</li>

        <li>There’s already one automatic commit to it</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Go to <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> on your
    profile</li>

    <li>Enable this “special” repo so others can see it!</li>

    <li>Go back to your files. Change the README.

      <ul>
        <li>You now have a local repo. Let’s change the README to
        a small intro for your github account. Mine is
        below!<br></li>
      </ul>

  <h2 id="gitignore">.gitignore</h2>

  <p>This deserves it’s own little section, because you’ll
  typically want to use these. Generally you want to be careful
  about blindly adding folders in Git. Why? Because there’s
  probably some big or sensitive files in them somewhere that you
  don’t want to upload.</p>

  <p>But adding things manually is so tedious… what if we could
  just specify what we want to ignore?</p>

  <p>Enter <code>.gitignore</code>. This is a special file (at the
  root of your repo) that git checks to remember what NOT to
  consider when it’s checking what you’ve changed. It also
  prevents certain files from being added when you add entire
  directories. It’s very useful when you don’t want to upload
  large data files, secret credentials, or small config files
  created by your IDE!</p>

  <p>A nice short-hand to add all the files at once! It’s
  recursive, so be careful</p>

  <h2 id="git-commit--m-my-message"><code>git commit -m "my

  <p>It’s important to have a descriptive message, especially if
  you’re working with other people. Saying “Fixed bug”
  isn’t very useful!</p>

  <h2 id="git-push"><code>git push</code></h2>

  <p>Git is decentralized. Your repository is local until you make
  it global. Use <code>git push</code> to send your changes off to
  the repository</p>

  <h2 id="git-pull"><code>git pull</code></h2>

  <p>If you’re working on a project on a lab computer and a home
  computer and making changes from both, pull the changes that you
  pushed from the other computer! Also, if you’re working with
  other people you want to make sure you have the latest
  changes</p>

  <h2 id="git-checkout-filename"><code>git checkout
  [filename]</code></h2>

  <p>This one is good to know. If you want to undo all the changes
  that you made to a file, you can just “checkout” that file
  from the last commit. Very good for undoing mistakes or
  accidental changes</p>

  <h1 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h1>

  <p>Using Git correctly helps future you and your teammates</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Make clean, single-purpose commits</li>

    <li>Don’t use <code>--force</code></li>

    <li>Write meaningful commit messages</li>

    <li>Don’t alter published history

      <ul>
        <li>I do this A LOT, but only on my personal projects</li>

        <li>You can re-write git history, but if anyone else is
        working with your code, it really screws them up and they
        will have to deal with a lot of errors when trying to merge
        or pulling</li>

        <li>Some companies use <em>advanced</em> git configurations
        to prevent this (look into “git hooks”)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Don’t commit generated files

      <ul>
        <li>if your code generates files every time you run it,
        don’t bother committing those!</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Don’t commit really big files that change often

      <ul>
        <li>your <code>.git/</code> folder will be bloated and
        you’ll have to use a tool like <a href=
        "https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/"><code>bfg</code></a>
        to clean it out</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Don’t commit sensitive information

      <ul>
        <li>This goes without saying, but if you submit passwords
        or API keys, you’ll need to edit the git history</li>

        <li>You can’t just submit a new commit, because someone
        could look at older commits</li>

        <li>Use <a href=
        "https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/"><code>bfg</code></a>
        to fix this mistake</li>
      </ul>

  <h3 id="git-integration">Git Integration</h3>

  <p>Almost every IDE (Integrated Developer Environment) that you
  use has git integration! For instance, Atom, IntelliJ, GoLand.
  It’s like a miniature GitHub desktop, except it’s not
  specific to GitHub!</p>

  <h3 id="are-there-other-version-control-systems">Are there other
  Version Control systems?</h3>

  <p>Yes, there are actually a few, and the following list is not
  exhaustive:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Git

      <ul>
        <li>Created in 2005 and currently the most used</li>

        <li>Decentralized, so you don’t need a central
        server</li>

        <li>Can have local changes and use it completely
        offline</li>

        <li>Written in C</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Mercurial

      <ul>
        <li>Decentralized, like Git</li>

        <li>Doesn’t have a Merge feature (some people really
        don’t like that)</li>

        <li>Written in Python</li>

        <li>Was competing with Git to be used by Linux Kernel,
        ultimately lost</li>

        <li>Easier to learn than Git, with better
        documentation</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>CVS [Concurrent Versions System]

      <ul>
        <li>a dinosaur from the 80’s</li>

        <li>Centralized, runs on your server</li>

        <li>You “check out” code, make changes, then “check
        in”</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>SVN [Apache SubVersioN]

      <ul>
        <li>A better version of CVS</li>

        <li>Centralized</li>

        <li>Not <em>totally</em> uncommon</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="cool-commands">Cool Commands</h3>

  <p>I have dozens of bash aliases set up for certain git commands.
  It helps to not need to remember or worry about certain things,
  like which branch you’re on.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>git whatchanged -p --abbrev-commit
      --pretty=medium</code>

      <ul>
        <li>HEAVEN SENT. This lets you view a <code>diff</code> of
        the past commits</li>

        <li>extremely useful to jog your memory on what was changed
        in the last commit</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <code>git diff</code>

      <ul>
        <li>this shows the you the difference between your current
        files and the last commit. Only more useful than the above
        when you haven’t committed yet</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <code>git reset</code>

      <ul>
        <li>This will do a <strong>soft</strong> reset and unstage
        any changes</li>

        <li>Useful for when you accidentally <code>git add</code> a
        file</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <code>git log --oneline --decorate --graph</code>

      <ul>
        <li>see a brief, visual summary of the branch
        histories</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <code>git status -s</code>

      <ul>
        <li>see which uncommitted files have changed!</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <code>git [push/pull] origin "$(git_current_branch)"</code>

      <ul>
        <li>this uses a built-in git method to grab your current
        branch</li>

        <li>most useful when you’re working with branches</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <code>git stash</code> and <code>git stash pop</code>

      <ul>
        <li>When you’re switching between branches and you
        don’t want to commit your changes yet, you can simply
        stash them. When you switch back to the branch, use
        <code>git stash pop</code> to pop them off the stash stack
        (data structures!)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <code>git cherry-pick</code>

      <ul>
        <li>This let’s you pluck a single commit from a different
        branch and add it to your current branch</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <code>git pull --rebase</code>

      <ul>
        <li>This is what some people actually use as their default
        pull command<br>
        &gt; “Whenever I pull, under most circumstances I git
        pull –rebase. This is because I like to see a linear
        history (my commit came after all commits that were pushed
        before it, instead of being developed in parallel). It
        makes history visualization much simpler and git bisect
        easier to see and understand. A specific circumstance in
        which you should avoid using <code>git pull --rebase</code>
        is if you merged since your last push. You might want to
        <code>git fetch; git rebase -p @{u}</code> (and check to
        make sure the merge was recreated properly) or do a normal
        merge in that circumstance.”</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="naughty-commands">Naughty Commands</h3>

  <p>Let’s talk about what you <em>shouldn’t</em> do, but might
  find useful. These all have to do with re-writing history. As a
  rule of thumb, you know that you’re doing something bad when
  you have to use <code>git push --force</code>, so please keep
  that in mind.</p>

  <p>When you use the <code>--force</code> flag, that means your
  local repo disagrees with the origin. However, if you haven’t
  <strong><code>pushed</code></strong> yet, then you can manipulate
  all your local commits however you want! That’s the ideal use
  case for these.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>git reset --hard [COMMIT HASH]</code>

      <ul>
        <li>Permanently time travel backwards to a specific
        commit</li>

        <li>This will destroy any changes you’ve made since then
        unless you’ve pushed them</li>

        <li>Find the commit hash using <code>git log</code></li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <code>git commit --amend</code>: edit your last commit
      message

      <ul>
        <li>I use this a lot for quick adjustments before I
        push</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <code>git add [file] &amp;&amp; git commit -v --no-edit
      --amend</code>

      <ul>
        <li>This adds a file to your last commit and re-submits
        it</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>An alias I personally use a lot when I’m making lots of
  small adjustments to something I just pushed is:</p>

  <div class="sourceCode" id="cb6">
    <pre class="sourceCode bash">
<code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-1"
title="1" name="cb6-1"><span class="bu">alias</span> <span class=
"st">&#39;oops!&#39;</span>=<span class=
"st">&#39;git add --all &amp;&amp; git commit -v --no-edit --amend &amp;&amp; git push -u --force $(git_current_branch)&#39;</span></a></code>
</pre>
  </div>

  <h2 id="plug-oh-my-zsh-git-aliases">Plug: Oh-my-zsh Git
  Aliases</h2>

  <p>If you use <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">Oh-My-Zsh</a> (I love
  it) instead BASH and have the <code>git</code> plugin, you have
  automatic access to <a href=
  "https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Cheatsheet#git">a
  plethora of git aliases</a>. As a small plug, Oh-My-Zsh is a ZSH
  framework that adds a ton of functionality to your terminal and
  has lots of <a href=
  "https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes">different shell
  prompts or “themes”</a>. Overall: Zsh + oh-my-zsh framework
  will give you auto-completion, tab completion, several cool
  themes, programming language integration and like bash is POSIX
  compliant (I suggest you not learn anything that isn’t—it
  won’t be generally portable knowledge).</p>

  <p>You can try out my personal ZSH + oh-my-zsh set-up, which will
  also make the aliases available to you as long as you’re in
  ZSH:</p>

  <div class="sourceCode" id="cb7">
    <pre class="sourceCode bash">
<code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-1"
title="1" name="cb7-1"><span class=
