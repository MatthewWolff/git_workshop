## What is Version Control?
Imagine you're working on a paper CancerEvolution.docx and you re-write a section but you're not sure if you want to keep it. Therefore, you "Save As" under "CancerEvolutionRewrite.docx". As you're working on this you end up re-writing another section and "Save As" to create a slightly different copy. Or maybe you just create draft after draft and want to have different versions for later. You're essentially creating different version of the same document and manually organizing them on your desktop! Not very effective though.

## What is Git?
A version control system for code! Gone are the days of "FinalPaperDraft.docx", "FinalPaperDraftFinal.docx", "FinalPaperDraftFinalFinal.docx".

> "By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source."

It's extremely useful for tracking and undoing changes to your code over time, as well as sharing your code with others.

## What is GitHub?
It's a online platform that lets you store and version control your code. It's built around Git. There are others like it, such as GitLab and BitBucket.

## So what's the meaningful difference between them?
Good question. Git exists purely on the command line, and is maintained independently from these platforms. You don't need to know the command line to use GitHub or GitLab, you just need to understand what version control is (and how to copy-paste)!

## How to use GitHub?
There are a few different ways!

1. Their Website -- [Github.com](http:/github.com)  
	<img src="./images/create_github_repo.png" alt="Creating a GitHub repo from GitHub Website" width="400"/>
2. The desktop app ‚Äì [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)  
	<img src="./images/github_desktop.png" alt="Creating a GitHub repo from GitHub Desktop" width="400"/>
3. The command line ‚Äì `hub` ‚Äì `brew install hub`  
	<img src="./images/github_cli.png" alt="Creating a GitHub repo from CLI" width="400"/>
	- the only\* thing you can't do with standalone `git` is create repositories
4. An IDE like Atom!  (GitHub integration)  
	<img src="./images/atom_github_support.png" alt="Creating a GitHub repo from Atom" width="400"/>

As a note, being a student gets you a [premium version (Github Student Dev pack)](https://education.github.com/pack) of Github for free

>It includes everything in GitHub Free, unlimited collaborators for private repositories, and advanced code review tools for private and public repositories.

# Git Concepts
## The Repository
* When you are working on a project and want to use version control, you need to first create a repository ("repo") for it
* You need to interface with Github for this (or install the `hub` command)
* It can be public or private
* The repository is where you'll send your updates

## Commits
* When you make changes, you need to submit them to be saved
* You need to specify which changes you want to save!
	- You might have various things that you're working on, and only finished one of them that you want to commit
* You must "git add" the files that you want to "save"
* A commit is like a "soft-save" because it's only local
	- this can be nice‚Äîyou don't always have an internet connection
* You need to publish your commits to make them global and visible to others!

## Pushing, Pulling
This is how we publish and retrieve changes!  

You push your local changes out to the repo, and then others can pull them in. Sometimes you've edited the same thing as someone else, and Git can't figure out how to automatically combine them‚Äîthis is when you'll need to decide what to keep and what to toss. Situations like this can be frustrating when you're working with other people, so sometimes it's nice to have your own git workspace.

## Branching and Merging
Want to start adding something new but don't want to interfere with the stable code? Time to start a new branch! By default, you're on the "master" branch.

```bash
> git checkout -b dev_branch
Switched to a new branch 'dev_branch'
```

Branches are useful for developing new features in isolation. Creating a new branch creates a copy of the old branch, but now you can grow it separately. When you're done, you can splice that branch back into the main tree!

What is this splicing exactly? It's the "merge" operation. Merging is best done when there aren't conflicts between the new cold and the old code, but Git helps you handle conflicts when they arise.

## What's all this about Origin and Master?
The "origin" is the remote location that is housing the code. By default, it is named "origin", which is just a convention that arose.  

You can set up different remote locations if you like‚ÄîI have set up both GitHub and GitLab on the same repository, I just needed to push my changes to each remote location.

The "master" is the default branch that is created when you're working on a project. It, too, is a common convention. Amazon uses "mainline' as their default name, and other companies are switching away from the "master" terminology. Branching is a useful feature for developing new or experimental changes in isolation without impacting the existing code.

## So these are all words, but can you give an analogy?
I think it all comes together like growing a **bonsai tree** in your house. All together, it's a gradual process where you can curate designs and shapes with the wood. You can keep the blinds closed or let specific people into your house!

**A Pot with Soil**: Having a GitHub or GitLab account is having a place to grow your plant. It's your pot with soil.

**A Seed**: Creating the repo is like planting a seed‚Äînow you can watch it grow.

**Taking up Nutrients...**: Adding changes to your files! These are what you need to grow the project.

**Growing Taller**: Committing those changes to your project grows it. Commit after commit, the project grows bigger.

**Opening the Blinds**: Push! People need to see your project! If you don't push your local changes to the repo, they might as well not exist! That said, you can push to a *private* repo, so that only people you let inside your house can see the bonsai tree.

**Branching**: Very literal here. You're growing out a new branch from the trunk. The trunk will continue to be the main part of the tree, but the branch can grow separately.

**Splicing A Branch Back In**: Merging! You're reintroducing a branch that previously diverged. Now it's part of the main tree again and brought back some changes with it.

This metaphor falls apart a bit once you start factoring in other people. For example, what exactly is a merge conflict on a bonsai tree? What is rebasing? There's probably a joke about `cherrypick`ing here (a surprisingly useful git command). But it's still a useful starting analogy.

## What Is It Under The Hood?
Complex and abstract. It's essentially a giant python dictionary with a few different types of objects in it (tree objects, commit objects, and blobs). At the same time, it holds within it a graph structure. Most people use it for years and years without ever bothering with what's going on underneath and, frankly, I think it's not worth understanding.

# Example
Let's create a repository!

1. You need to have a GitHub account
2. You need to have GitHub Desktop installed

So let's get started! GitHub has a few cute features with repos. For example, if you name it "[username].github.io" you can create your own small, static website! Try visiting [matthewwolff.github.io](https://matthewwolff.github.io)! Today, however, we're going to create a different kind of special repo.

1. Open GitHub desktop
2. Create a new (local) repository  
	<img src="./images/create_new_repo.png" width="400"/>
	- ctrl-N or CMD-N
	- The name will be your github username
	- Initialize it with a README
		- what is a readme?
		- what is markdown?
4. Publish your repository
	- Make sure it's public!
	- There's already one automatic commit to it
5. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) on your profile
6. Enable this "special" repo so others can see it!
7. Go back to your files. Change the README.   
	- You now have a local repo. Let's change the README to a small intro for your github account. Mine is below!  
	```md
	# Hey! üëª
	* UW ‚û°Ô∏è Computer Science, Genetics & Genomics
	* CMU ‚û°Ô∏è Computational üÖ±Ô∏èiology, Data Science

	![GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=matthewwolff&include_all_commits=true&include_private=true&hide=contribs&show_icons=true&&line_height=40)
	![Top Languages](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=matthewwolff&show_icons=true&hide=R,JavaScript,MATLAB&langs_count=7)
	```
8. Commit and Push!
9. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) on your profile again

# Command Line Git ‚Äì Key Commands
## Creation: `git init` and `git remote`
This is how you create a local project!
```bash
git init # create the .git folder
git remote -v # you have nowhere to send your changes!
git remote add origin https://github.com/matthewwolff/github_workshop
git remote -v # origin is now set!
```

## `git status`
Git will automatically evaluate which files have been changed, created, or deleted, and will then give you a quick report
```bash
> git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add [file]..." to include in what will be committed)

	README.md
	images/
	index.html

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

## `git add --all`
A nice short-hand to add all the files at once! It's recursive, so be careful

## `git commit -m "my message"`
It's important to have a descriptive message, especially if you're working with other people. Saying "Fixed bug" isn't very useful!

## `git push`
Git is decentralized. Your repository is local until you make it global. Use `git push` to send your changes off to the repository

## `git pull`
If you're working on a project on a lab computer and a home computer and making changes from both, pull the changes that you pushed from the other computer! Also, if you're working with other people you want to make sure you have the latest changes

## `git checkout [filename]`
This one is good to know. If you want to undo all the changes that you made to a file, you can just "checkout" that file from the last commit. Very good for undoing mistakes or accidental changes

## All Together

```bash
mkdir my_project && cd my_project
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/matthewwolff/github_workshop
git status

echo "# My Project" >> README.md # create a change

git add --all
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push # publish it

rm README.md # oops
git checkout README.md
```

# Misc.
### .gitignore
This is a special file that git uses to remember what NOT to consider when it's checking what you've changed. It's very useful when you don't want to upload large data files, secret credentials, or small files created by your IDE!

#### [gitignore.io](https://gitignore.io) - very useful for autogenerating this for certain platforms/languages/tools

### Git Integration
Almost every IDE (Integrated Developer Environment) that you use has git integration! For instance, Atom, IntelliJ, GoLand. It's like a miniature GitHub desktop, except it's not specific to GitHub!

### Are there other Version Control systems?
Yes, there are actually a few.

* Git
	- Created in 2005 and currently the most used
	- Decentralized, so you don't need a central server
	- Can have local changes and use it completely offline
	- Written in C
* Mercurial
	- Decentralized, like Git
	- Doesn't have a Merge feature (some people really don't like that)
	- Written in Python
	- Was competing with Git to be used by Linux Kernel, ultimately lost
	- Easier to learn than Git, with better documentation
* CVS [Concurrent Versions System]
	- a dinosaur from the 80's
	- Centralized, runs on your server
	- You "check out" code, make changes, then "check in"
* SVN [Apache SubVersioN]
	- A better version of CVS
	- Centralized
	- Not *totally* uncommon
